# Period Tracker

## Why

* I wanted to play with some of the cool new browser API (service workers, add to home screen, background sync, etc...)
* I wanted a light app that does exactly what I need with only a couple of tap
* I wanted the data to be easy to backup and retrieve (using Google Calendar)

#### TODO
* [ ] service worker - work offline 
* [X] add to home screen
* [ ] push notifications
* [ ] background syncronisation
* [ ] use google calendar as backend server
* [X] calculate average interval between events
* [X] calculate next event
* [X] show error if erroring when add/update/delete
* [ ] when during event, different homescreen
* [X] fix when data is empty
* [ ] implement edit entry functionality
